Comment:
 CRC algorithm code taken from CRC-32 by Craig Bruce.
 The module stuff is inspired by a similar perl module called
 String::CRC by David Sharnoff & Matthew Dillon.
 Horst Fickenscher told me that it could be useful to supply an init
 value to the crc checking function and so I included this possibility.
